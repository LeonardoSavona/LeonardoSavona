## 👋 Hi, I'm Leonardo Savona

I'm a backend developer with a strong foundation in **Java**, but I'm not limited to just one language or technology. I love to **learn**, **adapt**, and **explore**—whether it’s picking up a new language, diving into unfamiliar frameworks, or tackling new challenges.

---

### 💻 What I Do

- 🔁 **Microservices Architectures** – designing and maintaining scalable systems built for flexibility and performance.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Data Processing** – experienced in working with **Apache Kafka** to handle high-throughput event streams.
- 🔍 **Big Data & Search** – leveraging **Elasticsearch** to make sense of massive datasets with powerful search capabilities.
- 🧪 **Testing & Reliability** – writing robust **unit and integration tests** using **Testcontainers**, ensuring quality from development to deployment.

### 🧠 What Drives Me

Curiosity. I'm always eager to expand my knowledge, understand how things work under the hood, and stay up-to-date with the latest backend technologies and best practices.

> _“Stay curious, keep coding.”_
